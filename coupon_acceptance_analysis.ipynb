    "\n",
    "The results suggest that a driver's mindset strongly influences whether a coupon is accepted. Bar coupons had the lowest acceptance rate, which makes sense since drivers are unlikely to stop for a drink while on the road. Carry out & Take away coupons had the highest acceptance rate, indicating that drivers prefer options that allow for quick stops while continuing toward their destination.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Prioritize food-based coupons** for maximum acceptance rates across all driver contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time coffee house coupons strategically** \u2014 Target mid-morning (10AM) and early afternoon (2PM), avoid evening hours (6PM+)\n",

    "3. **Target coffee coupons based on behavior** \u2014 Focus on users with history of coffee house visits; don't waste coupons on non-coffee drinkers\n",

    "4. **Consider destination context** \u2014 Avoid sending discretionary coupons (coffee, bars) to drivers heading home; they're focused on getting there, not stopping"
